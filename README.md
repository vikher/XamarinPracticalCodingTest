# Programming Problem

Provide a production ready solution that accepts a new user name, validates a single string input as the password, and
stores it locally. The solution should be written in C#/Xamarin with native UI (Android or iOS, your choice, not Xamarin
Forms)

## UI requirements:
1. The UI should have at least a page that is a list of users and their information.
2. The UI should have the ability to add a new user, which brings up a new screen, and then appends that user to the
bottom of the list view.
3. Alert the user if their passwords are invalid either on submission or real time.
## The following are the string validations:
1. String must consist of a mixture of letters and numerical digits only, with at least one of each.
2. String must be between 5 and 12 characters in length.
3. String must not contain any sequence of characters immediately followed by the same sequence
